## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite apps and their features:
- Instagram: Reels, Stories
- Linkedin: Connect with professionals, find jobs
- Phone: Make calls, save contacts

An app i'd like to make:
- I would like to build an app called FocusPod, designed to help users manage their screen time by combining productivity techniques with social accountability. The app would allow users to set 
  daily screen time limits for different apps, initiate focus sessions where certain apps are blocked, and join group "focus pods" where friends or colleagues work simultaneously and encourage 
 each other.

## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
- The main challenge faced was pushing the code to github, as I had initially set it up incorrectly
